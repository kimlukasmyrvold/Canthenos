## How to run:
1. clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/kimlukasmyrvold/Canthenos```
2. cd into the new directory: ```cd Canthenos```
3. run the website with this command: ```npm start```

## How to modify the css:
1. run command: ```npm run sass```
2. go into the `Canthenos.Web` directory where you will find the `wwwroot` directory.
3. find the `scss` folder
4. Edit the scss files

### Cannot see changes after editing scss files?
- check if `npm run sass` is running and that there are no erros with the scss
- refresh the browser window without cache. To do so, try the following: `ctrl + F5`, `shift + F5` or `ctrl + shift + r`

## Why Canthenos?
I called it Canthenos because it somewhat resembles the word canteen and I did not want to call it Canteen project or something like that.
